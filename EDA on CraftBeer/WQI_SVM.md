## Water Quaility Index predictor using Support Vector Regression
***

__This project aims to predict and classify the wqi of given area with high accuracy and low errors, here SVR regression algorithm is used based on polynomial kernel which makes predictions using non linear features very easy and efficient.__

-> Primarily, the dataset was collected from https://cpcb.nic.in/

-> Secondarily, feature engineering was performed on the aggregated data.

-> WQI is calculated based on the independent features.

-> SVR algorithm is applied.

-> WQI has been classified based on it's value.

-> Libraries used : numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn

_This project was implemented for the 5th semester PCL in college._
